# A Simple Service

A simple and configurable service that can, for example, be used for testing container orchestration setups (incl. health check endpoint).

Note that the versions of `simpleservice`, such as `0.4.0`, used in the following refer to the tags used in the respective [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/mhausenblas/simpleservice/tags/) created. There are no tags or releases as such in this GitHub repo.

        "host": "localhost:9876",
        "result": "all is well",
        "version": "0.4.0"
    }

## Running it

For local execution, Python `3.9.2` is required. You can then run `simpleservice` like so:

    # with defaults:
    $ python simpleservice.py

    # overwriting certain runtime settings:
    $ HEALTH_MAX=200 VERSION=1.0 python simpleservice.py

If you fancy it you can run the containerized version of `simpleservice` on your local machine (requires Docker installed):

    $ docker run -P mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.5.0

See also the [container images](https://hub.docker.com/r/mhausenblas/simpleservice/tags/).


## Changing runtime behaviour

Through setting the following environment variables, you can change the runtime behaviour of `simpleservice`:

- `PORT0` ... the port `simpleservice` is serving on
- `VERSION` ... the value of `version` returned in the JSON response of the `/endpoint0` endpoint
- `HEALTH_MIN` and `HEALTH_MAX` ... the min. and max. delay in milliseconds that the `/health` endpoint responds

## Invoking it

Once `simpleservice` is started you can invoke it like so (here is a local service execution shown):

    $ http localhost:9876/endpoint0
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 71
    Content-Type: application/json
    Date: Tue, 11 Oct 2016 16:57:33 GMT
    Etag: "ce18606c019e1d8c584b796d1fe7402d9767b9b6"
    Server: TornadoServer/4.3

    {
        "host": "localhost:9876",
        "result": "all is well",
        "version": "0.4.0"
    }

And the service logs would show something like:

    ~$ python simpleservice.py
    This is a simple service in version v0.4.0 listening on port 9876
    2016-10-11T05:57:33 INFO /endpoint0 serving from localhost:9876 has been invoked from 127.0.0.1 [at line 58]
    2016-10-11T05:57:33 INFO 200 GET /endpoint0 (127.0.0.1) 1.10ms [at line 1946]

Note that the available endpoints depend on the version of `simpleservice` as defined in the first section of this docs (aka API).
